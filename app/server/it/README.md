The tests in this folder are integration tests that require the app to be running at localhost.

We'll make this configurable in the future, but for now make sure the app is running at localhost:3000 and that you have GitHub credentials so it will work.

A mock service will be added shortly so that the GitHub API is not getting hit all the time.
